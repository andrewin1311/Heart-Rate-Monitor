    <h1>Challenges and Issues</h1>
    <p>
      We encountered various issues when implementing our project, but the biggest one was
      getting the sensor to read properly. There was not much documentation on the heart rate
      sensor we used, so we had to figure out how it worked on our own. After many hours of
      tinkering, we concluded that our sensor might be defective.

      From our understanding, the sensor reads fluctuations in light to detect pulses. However,
      ours consistently returned a raw analog value of 4095, regardless of lighting conditions.
      Additionally, we discovered the LED component was not functioning, which left us unsure of
      what the sensor was even detecting. We tried several test codes and scoured various online
      forums, many of which had users reporting similar issues. Unfortunately, it appears that we 
      received a faulty unit as well.
