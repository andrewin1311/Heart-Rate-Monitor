        <h1> What does our project do? </h1>
        <p>Our project aims to provide users a way to measure their heart rates with a friendly user interface. On top
            of this, our project aims to deliver users the ability to track certain aspects of their day to watch and 
            record their heart rates, in case they plan to do specific tasks which may involve an elevated heart rate. 
            Allowing users to keep track of specific periods throughout their day allows care-free and easy access to heart 
            monitoring to ensure that they stay safe and that their hearts well being is never at risk. If a user does
            happen to have an elevated heart rate, we also have the ability to raise a buzzer alarm to signify to the user they 
            are above an "unsafe" threshold. </p>
